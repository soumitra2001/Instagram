## Project Summary :

`This project is an Instagram-like application developed in Java. It provides functionalities for users to sign up, sign in, follow other users, like posts, add comments, and perform administrative tasks. The application follows a controller-based architecture, with separate controllers for user actions, administrative tasks, comments, and posts. Users can interact with the application through the UserController, AdminController, CommentController, and PostController classes. The UserController handles user-related actions such as sign up, sign in, following users, and liking posts. The AdminController is responsible for administrative tasks, such as verifying users with a blue tick. The CommentController allows users to add comments to posts, and the PostController handles actions related to posts, including adding posts and retrieving all posts. The code in this repository provides a foundation for building an Instagram-like application and can be further developed and customized as per specific requirements`
